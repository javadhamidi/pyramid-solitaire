1. Generate deck of 52 cards as strings in an array called 'deck' (without 
   manaually typing all 52 elements in the array).

2. Create function to 'shuffle' a given array (based on the Fisher–Yates 
   shuffle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Modern_method).

3. Generate a text-based card pyramid, using the shuffled deck, that is 
   printed to the command window.

4. Create a function to draw cards from the shuffled deck (created in the 
   previous steps). Then print the drawn card to the command window, with 
   points on the foundation marked.

5. Create skeleton code for what accepting user input for various game 
   operations (draw card, move card, quit, etc.) would look like.

6. Combine input gathering code with pyramid output code from steps 1-4.

7. Create function to move cards from the stock to the draw pile, and allow  
   user input to perform this operation.

Stage 8 and 9 will focus on implementing the ability to move cards from the 
draw pile onto the foundation, making card pairs that add up to 13. These 
are automatically sent to the discard pile.

8. Sanatising user input, and ensuring valid parameters are given in the 
   move command.

9. Complete functionality started in part 8, manipulating relevent vectors 
   in moving cards from one pile to the others.

10. Allow the user to move one foundation card onto another if both add up 
   in value to 13. 

##. Given the large amount of repeated code in iterations 9 and 10, some of 
    the 'move' command functionality will be moved into a function.

11. Implementing the ability to move a king directly to the discard pile 
   (as the point value of a king is 13).
