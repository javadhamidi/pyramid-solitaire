1. Generate deck of 52 cards as strings in an array called 'deck' (without 
   manaually typing all 52 elements in the array).

2. Create function to 'shuffle' a given array (based on the Fisher–Yates 
   shuffle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Modern_method).

3. Generate a text-based card pyramid, using the shuffled deck, that is 
   printed to the command window.

4. Create a function to draw cards from the shuffled deck (created in the 
   previous steps). Then print the drawn card to the command window.

5. Accept user input for various game operations (draw card, move card, 
   quit, etc.).
