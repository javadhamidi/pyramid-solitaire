The shuffle function randomly shifts the order of a given vector. Given 
that the result should be random, not one expected output can be predicted.
Below are some tests (with smaller vectors than the one containing all 52 
cards) where all permutations are listed, and the shuffle function was 
tested. 

Note that it is possible for the deck to be shuffled, and for the order of 
the deck to not change. In the very unlikely event that this occurs with a 
vector of 52 elements, I have determined this not to be severely 
detrimental to game play.
