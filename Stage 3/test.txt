The purpose of s3 is to deal the first few elements into a pyramid-like 
vector that can be easily manipulated, and then to print that vector in 
a pyramid shape to the command window (as a single string with newline 
characters).

Note: Variables in the script were reassigned for these test cases. These 
variables may be constants in the final product, but are modified to test 
for robustness and as a proof of concept.


---- TEST 1 ----
deck = [ "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9" "10" "11" "12" "13" "14" "15" ];
boardSize = 4; (for three rows and three columns)

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

pyramid = [ "1" "" "" ""; 
            "2" "3" "" "";
            "4" "5" "6" ""; 
            "7" "8" "9" "10" ];

command window output:    1
