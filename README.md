# Pyramid Solitaire
Thought I'd put this on GitHub in case it inspires someone else who needs to make a MATLAB project. Sorry for the obscene amount of commenting ðŸ˜‹. 

I would strongly suggest **not** copying my code if you're working in an academic setting (for your sake and mine), hence, I haven't included any sort of open-source license.  I expect people who buy MathWorks licences don't do it for the dinky card-games anyway.

Here's a snippet of what the game might look like when you run it:

```
 ========= PYRAMID =========

             7H              CARDS IN STOCK: 0
           AS  10H           DRAWN CARD: None
         3S  QH  JH          
       10C 7C  2D  JD        CARDS IN DISCARD: 0
     10D JC  9S  QC  6D      
   AH  JS  3D  8C  KC  4S
