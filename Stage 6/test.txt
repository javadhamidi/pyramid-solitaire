This iteration involves integrating the code from stage 4 and 5. Code from 
stage 4 has since been abstracted into the generateBoard function, and 
using the tests from that iteration appears to produce similar results:

EXPECTED OUTPUT

GIVEN OUTPUT
board =              8D              CARDS IN STOCK: 0
                   4S  KC            DRAWN CARD: None
                 10H AH  6S          
               7C  6H  2C  KD        CARDS IN DISCARD: 0
             2D      AC  10S 8C      
           QS          4H  2H      
          1              7S        
                         2    

Testing the game commands ('move', 'draw', 'reset', etc.) also render the 
same results with the same conditions.
